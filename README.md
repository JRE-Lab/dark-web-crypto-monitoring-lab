# Dark-Web Crypto Monitoring Lab

This repository contains materials for a dark-web market and cryptocurrency monitoring lab. It demonstrates how to responsibly collect intelligence from dark-net forums and marketplaces and correlate it with on‑chain transaction data.

## Overview

You will:

- Configure a secure VM and Tor gateway to access dark‑web marketplaces safely.
- Identify and collect marketplace listings, vendor profiles, and crypto wallet addresses using OSINT techniques.
- Use open-source blockchain explorers and Python libraries to trace Bitcoin/Ethereum transactions and detect patterns.
- Maintain an ethical posture by avoiding illicit purchases and anonymizing any identifiers.
- Summarize findings in a risk report linking vendors, goods and financial flows.

All data in this lab is gathered from public darknet forums and public blockchain data and is used for research and threat intelligence purposes.
